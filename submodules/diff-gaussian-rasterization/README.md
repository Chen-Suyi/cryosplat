# Differential Gaussian Rasterization

This module is derived from the rasterization engine introduced in:

Kerbl, B., Kopanas, G., Leimkühler, T., & Drettakis, G.  
**3D Gaussian Splatting for Real-Time Radiance Field Rendering**  
ACM Transactions on Graphics (SIGGRAPH 2023)

The original implementation is available at:  
https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting

This version contains significant modifications to the core
computational components for research purposes, while preserving
the original licensing terms.
